# Goal:

The goal of this project is to build 30 web-artifacts in a year, starting on October 9th 2016.

I might occasionally comment about this on my [blog](http://mcmonkeyman.github.io/).

I hope to fail fast. If I canâ€™t get 2 artifacts built a month (not including this one) for the first three months I will abandon this project.

# Rules:
Each web-artifact I create must be:

- Visable on the web (reachable at some address)
- Have a project page (eg: Github)

It may also  include an optional blog post if the subject or the code produced is sufficiently interesting.

# Ideas built so far:

- This site

# Ideas:
- Site with all the good resources I've found in my career so far organized and laid out in a clear manner
- Pluto shapes visualized on a map
- Site name generator
- A family tree site to help people build and connect their family trees.
- A site to build a pie chart that shows the aggregate facebook relationship status of all your friends

# Terms:
-   web-artifact - web-sites, web-page or web-app
